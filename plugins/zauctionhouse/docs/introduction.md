# zAuctionHouse

Welcome to the zAuctionHouse documentation!

zAuctionHouse is a powerful and highly customizable auction house plugin for Minecraft servers. It integrates seamlessly with zMenu for fully customizable inventory interfaces.

## Features

- **Multiple Economies** - Support for Vault, PlayerPoints, Experience, Levels, Items, and many more
- **Categories** - Organize items into customizable categories
- **Search System** - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **Bidding System** - Optional auction bidding functionality
- **Statistics** - Track sales, purchases, and player activity (addon)
- **zMenu Integration** - Fully customizable interfaces using zMenu
- **Anti-Lag System** - Built-in protection against high ping and low TPS
- **Anti-Dupe** - Protection against item duplication
- **Tax System** - Configurable taxes on sales or purchases
- **Multi-Database** - SQLite, MySQL, Redis, or JSON storage

## Why zMenu?

zAuctionHouse uses the zMenu API, giving you access to all zMenu features:
- 9+ button types
- 28+ action types
- Pattern support
- PlaceholderAPI integration
- And much more

Existing DeluxeMenu configurations work automatically with zMenu - simply transfer your configuration files to the `inventories` folder.

:::warning
Disabling zMenu is not recommended as you will lose access to many features and customization options.
